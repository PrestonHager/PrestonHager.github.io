![Preston Hager](/profile-pic.jpg)

Hi! My name is Preston, I'm currently a Computer Science student in New Mexico.
I've been programming for awhile. I started with Python and have had the
opportunity to work with many platforms, frameworks, and languages since then.

Check out some of my projects on [GitHub][1].

I also do amateur rocketry, amateur radio, and aviation!
