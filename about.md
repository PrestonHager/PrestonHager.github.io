I'm a student in the Portland area who loves to code.
I know over 10 different programming languages but
I like to focus on Python, Assembly, Swift, and HTML/Javascript/CSS.
I also really like physics and aerospace.

Current Big/Leading Project: [Startaste][1] another OS,
this one uses Reactive programming though.
It's not very complete yet.
[Sound Bytes][2] is a social media application, with the help of AWS it
brings short podcast-like bites of information to users.
While aimed towards those who want quick information on everything,
the ability to link to a longer article or podcast is also possible.

All my projects are also on my [GitHub][3] account.
I like to make tools or things that automate other things.
I've also worked with Raspberry Pi's, Arduinos, and other engineering
things to create random projects.

Finally, I am also a photographer.
You can find more about my photography on the [Photography][4] page.
